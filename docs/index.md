# Troo 1.1 API Documentation

## Script Commands

This section contains commands to create a script, parent and name it. <br></br>
All script commands follow the same format and order `parent.class.name`. **TO ADD LOCAL SCRIPT INSTEAD OF A REGULAR SCRIPT, USE `lscript` AS CLASS INSTEAD OF JUST `script`** <br>
A **name** parameter is **mandatory**

<h3>QUICK TIPS</h3>

Whenever using these commands, the parent parameter will always be a `Service`, such as `ServerScriptService`, `ReplicatedStorage` etc. When denoting them in the parent parameter, if the service is only one word, it is usually denoted by its starting letter. If the service contains more than one word, the parameter is usually the short form. If it does not work, please review the full API Documentation below for the correct command.
