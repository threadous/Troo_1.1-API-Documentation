# Troo 1.1 Documentation 

## Introduction
Troo is a ROBLOX plugin and instant command panel that makes adding items to ROBLOX Studio much easier. It would be faster and efficient to type in a simple easy to remember command to create a script for example rather than do it the classic way. Utilizes Luau programming language.

For example, instead of following the classical method to add a script to workspace and naming it `TrooTest`, it would be much easier to use the command `wscript/TrooTest`. As you can see `w` is the parent `workspace`, the second argument is the class, in this case `script`, and the third argument is the name `TrooTest`. A prefix `/` is used to indicate the name. 

## Benefits Of Using Troo
Memorizing commands is not as hard as it looks. Most commands use the same format as the example given above i.e. `[PARENT][CLASS][NAME]` unless it applies to building utilities such as `BaseParts` etc. 

## Permits
All users are permitted to **only** __use__ this plugin in any way but nobody is permitted to re-make this plugin, which includes any adjustments.
